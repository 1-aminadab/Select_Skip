## ‚ú® My Approach to the Redesign

### üß© 1. Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- Transformed layout into **modern glassmorphism-based cards** with spacing, shadows, and rounded corners.
- Each skip bin is shown in a consistent grid, making comparison easy and clear.
- Clear **"Selected" badges** with highlighted states for active items.

### üé® 2. Color Scheme & Branding
- Adopted a **yellowish and bluish color palette** to reflect REM Waste's brand.
- **Glassmorphism design** reflects transparency and cleanliness‚Äîsymbolic of REM Waste‚Äôs environmental values.
- Primary actions are colored with **eco-friendly green or bright yellow highlights**, enhancing visibility and call-to-action focus.

### üì± 3. Improved Usability
- Redesigned **step navigation bar** with large icons and labels for better understanding of progress.
- Added hover and active states for **"Select" and "Selected" buttons**.
- Each skip now includes **a description and ideal use case**, helping users make informed choices.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Restrictions & Warnings
- Used **color-coded badges**: red for ‚Äúroad restrictions,‚Äù yellow for ‚Äúheavy waste,‚Äù etc.
- Disabled skip options when restricted, with tooltip descriptions and faded visuals.
- Ensures users are **informed before making a mistake**.

### üß† 5. User Interaction & Summary Bar
- **Sticky bottom bar** added for showing selected skip, price, and navigation.
- Makes it easy to navigate back or proceed without scrolling up/down.
